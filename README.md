# MarioThesisGenerator
The generator I used for my master's thesis at Jönköping University's AI engineering programme. To generate levels using the fitness functions I defined in the study  run the CMAMarioSolver class using Java 8. You will need a python environment with pytorch 0.3.1 and torchvision 0.2.0 and point to it in the Settings class.
